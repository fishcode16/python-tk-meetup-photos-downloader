Python/Tk Meetup Photos Downloader was created to help you download your meetup events' photo albums easily.

I decided to write this program during the COVID-19 lockdown (~March 2020).  Concept/idea is from [Ken Courville](https://github.com/krcourville/meetup-photo-download), which was no longer functioning.
